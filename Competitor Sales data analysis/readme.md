<p> <b>This project is based on  a fictional company named Sintec. Its primary objectives include analyzing Sintec's internal sales trends, examining the sales data of its competitors, and conducting a comparative assessment of product performance against those competitors:</b> </p>

<h2>Step 1: Data Preparation</h2>
In the initial phase of the project, I focused on data preparation. I gathered data from various sources, including internal sales records and information about competitors. This involved importing and integrating data into Power BI to create a comprehensive dataset.

<h2>Step 2: Data Preprocessing </h2>
Once the data was collected, I performed several data preprocessing tasks. This included cleaning and enhancing the data for analysis. I addressed missing values, converted data types as necessary, split data where required, and transformed tables to better suit the analysis. Additionally, I consolidated data from multiple sources into a single, unified table.

<h2>Step 3: Data Modeling </h2>
In the data modeling stage, I organized the dataset to facilitate analysis. I used a structured approach, similar to a snowflake schema, to establish logical relationships between different data elements. This step was essential for a clear understanding of the data's structure and relationships.

<h2>Step 4: Metric Calculation with DAX </h2>
Utilizing Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), I calculated various metrics that would provide valuable insights. DAX is a powerful language in Power BI that allowed me to derive meaningful KPIs and metrics from the data. I used DAX to compute relevant statistics and performance indicators.

<h2>Step 5: Data Analysis </h2>
With the data properly organized and metrics calculated, I conducted an in-depth analysis. I identified critical business insights, including pinpointing the top competitors, determining the total market share, and assessing the total revenue. I also compared sales growth to the previous year and identified the best-selling products, along with the number of units sold.

<h2>Step 6: Interactive Dashboard Creation </h2>
To support data-driven decision-making, I designed an interactive dashboard. This dashboard visually presented the insights gained from the data analysis. Users could interact with the data, exploring information through charts, graphs, and tables. The interactive dashboard provided a user-friendly means of extracting valuable insights.

<h2>Step 7: Conclusion </h2>
In conclusion, my analysis revealed that Sintec, the fictional company, held a substantial 38.22% market share in the United States. Notably, the company experienced impressive growth of 18.8% in 2021 compared to the previous year. In Germany, the brand "Artisans" emerged as a market leader, contributing to over 50% of the total revenue. Globally, Sintec maintained a 21.15% market share. These findings equip Sintec with crucial information for making well-informed business decisions and developing strategic plans for the future.
